                The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers where each number
                is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0
                and 1. That is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, â€¦

                Now, would it be great to see if this was drawed out on graphs and

                Well, this website is designed to give you, the user, 
                an experience of observing the sequence expressed in visualization 
                forms other than a boring, long length of number.

                To start, simplying click on the plus sign element 
                and once you do so, you will be presented with three options from the 
                selection; line, scatter and bar. Click on the selection list to confirm
                your desire for the option. Once clicked, a graph or chart window would
                appears in the playground and to extend the customization, you can change
                any colors presented on the window by selecting color from the selection 
                positioned right to the plus sign element.

              <p className="text-sm">And...enjoy! You now have a window, representing a 
                visualization of fibonacci sequence. However, playground offers more than
                 simply spawning a window displaying a sequence.

              <p className="text-sm">
                To make context of how website takes in number,
                 computes the sequence and reflects it on the graphs, you have to 
                 looks on the mathematics side.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">
                The fibonacci sequence has a formula and it looks like this -
              </p>
              <div className="formula-displayer bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 p-2 rounded-sm ">
                <span className=" block text-lg font-jetbrains">F<small className="text-xs font-jetbrains">n</small> = F<small className="text-xs font-jetbrains">n-1</small>+F<small className="text-xs font-jetbrains">n-2</small></span>
                <span className=" block text-lg font-jetbrains">n<small className="text-xs font-jetbrains">0</small> = 0 & n<small className="text-xs font-jetbrains">1</small> = 1</span>
                <span className="block font-jetbrains text-lg">Where n = 1</span>
              </div>
              <p className="text-sm">
                Have looking at the formula, it can be made out clearly that you can render 
                a sequence by entering certain n value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">
                Here's an example: What would a sequence looks like 
                if n of 12 is entered?
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">
                As seen here, the n is 12 and sequence has to be rendered 
                based on that. Firstly, an array of sequence containing the result of n starting 
                from 1 has to be intitated. This is must for in order to make computation using
                formula possible.
              </p>
              <div className="example-sequence-displaying bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 p-2 rounded-sm">
                <span className="text-sm font-jetbrains text-center">F = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89]</span>
              </div>
              <p className="text-sm">
                With the array representing number starting from one all the way 
                to eleven, the calculation on n 12 can be carried out. Refering 
                to the formula, the calculation would looks like this -
              </p>
              <div className="example-calculation-displaying bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 p-2 rounded-sm">

                <span className="text-sm font-jetbrains text-center flex items-center">F<small className="text-xs ">12</small> = 144</span>
              </div>
              <p className="text-sm">And the result of 12 as n for input is 144.</p>
              <p className="text-sm">Now, move on to the programming side. The formula for the sequence 
                can be used as a blueprint and used as base algorithm for computations. It would looks like this -
              </p>
              <div className="example-algorithm-codebase-displaying bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 p-2 rounded-sm">

              <p className="text-sm">
                The structure of the snippet above can be made out and viewed similarly
                to the formula. You can execute the 
                <span className="font-jetbrains text-xs bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded-sm">fibonaaciSequenceComputation</span>
                function by calling <span className="font-jetbrains text-xs bg-gray-100 p-1 rounded-sm">fibonaaciSequenceComputation(12)</span>. This will return an array containing a sequence including 144
                as the last index.

              <p className="text-sm">
                Everytime a window is spawned, the function is executed and return a result, which then will be reflected on the chart within the window.
              </p>
              <p className="text-sm">Now, you have reached the stage where you can able to understand how the sequence is created and how is it reflected in programming.</p>
